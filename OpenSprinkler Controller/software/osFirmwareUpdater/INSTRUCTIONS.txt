==========================================================================

This firmware updater is discontinued. Please use the new Qt-Based program,
available at: https://github.com/rayshobby/osFWUpdater

==========================================================================









====== Preparation ======

You need a regular-size (A Male to B Male) USB cable. Most
printers use this type of cable.

Please run the 'osFirmwareUpdater' program in the folder
that corresponds to your operating system:

* For Windows: if it reports 'javaw.exe' not found, please
  go to www.java.com, download and install Java.

* For Mac: if it reports error 'Application is damaged and
  canâ€™t be opened', you need to temporarily change the
  settings in Security and Privacy (under System Preferences)
  to allow applications downloaded from anywhere.

* For Linux: run the program in 'sudo', unless if you have
  udev rules set for the corresponding USB devices (USBasp or USBtiny).


====== Driver ======

Mac and Linux do not need drivers.

For Windows, you need to install driver:
  * For OpenSprinkler 2.1: USBasp driver (http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/)
  * For OpenSprinkler 2.0: USBtinyISP (https://learn.adafruit.com/usbtinyisp/drivers)


====== Instructions ======

1. If you have OpenSprinkler 2.1: please first enter bootloader:
   turn off controller, press and hold button B2 while plugging
   in USB cable, then release the button within 1-2 seconds;
   
   For other versions of OpenSprinkler:
   Just plug in the USB cable.

2. Click on 'Update and Detect'. The software will automatically
   detect the OpenSprinkler version you have, and download the
   latest firmware for your device.

3. If you have OpenSprinkler 2.1: please re-enter bootloader, 
   then click on the 'Upload' button.
   
   For other versions of OpenSprinkler:
   Just click on the 'Upload' button.

NOTE: You can also skip Step 2 above, and instead manually select
      a device and firmware version to upload.
